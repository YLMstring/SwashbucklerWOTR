Adds the [Swashbuckler](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/hybrid-classes/swashbuckler/) class and some feats that fit the theme.

## Deviations from TableTop
* Some abilities which required immediate action now only use free action.
* Improved Feint is refashioned as Feint and now gives the ability to feint.
* Swordplay Style does not require choosing one weapon type.
* Lillend's Misdirection attempts a pull combat maneuver.
* Whimsical Riposte provides Charisma bonus to attack and damage rolls for all attacks of opportunity.
